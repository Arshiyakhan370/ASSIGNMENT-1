        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>A bull is an intact (i.e., not castrated) adult male of the species Bostaurus (cattle). More muscular and aggressive than the females of thesame species (i.e. cows proper), bulls have long been an importantsymbol in many religions, including for sacrifices. These animalsplay a significant role in beef ranching, dairy farming, and avariety of sporting and cultural activities, including bullfighting  and bull riding.                                                                                                                                                                                              
            Bulls are much more muscular than cows, with thicker bones, larger feet, a very muscular neck, and a large, bony head with protective ridges over the eyes. These features assist bulls in fighting for domination over a herd, giving the winner superior access to cows for reproduction.[5] The hair is generally shorter on the body, but the neck and head often have a "mane" of curlier, wooly hair. Bulls are usually about the same height as cows or a little taller, but because of the additional muscle and bone mass, they often weigh far more. Most of the time, a bull has a hump on his shoulders.[6]</p>
